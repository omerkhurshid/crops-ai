## üí° **Launch Strategy Recommendation**

**Recommended Approach**: **Soft Launch** with payment system
- Launch with Stripe integration for paid users
- Basic admin tools for user management
- Focus on core agricultural features
- Expand community and advanced features post-launch

**Alternative**: **Beta Launch** without payments
- Launch as free beta to gather user feedback
- Build payment system based on user behavior
- Risk: No revenue generation during beta

---

**Next Action**: Begin Stripe integration immediately as it's the primary launch blocker.
